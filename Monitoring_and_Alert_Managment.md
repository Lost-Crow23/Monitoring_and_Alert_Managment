<h1>Monitoring and Alert Managment</h1>

<h3>What you do you need to monitor?</h3>

-	Aws environment consists of continuous monitoring, e.g determines which changes to make to reduce costs, improve performance and secure your systems. 

-	Performance efficiency, Security posture, cost optimization, reliability, and operational excellence.


<h3>What are the golden rules of monitoring?</h3>

Collect all relevant data

- Monitor all relevant metrics and logs, including performance metrics, system logs, and application logs.

Automate your monitoring

- Use automation tools to monitor your AWS resources, set up alerts, and respond to incidents automatically.

Analyze and correlate data

- Analyze and correlate data from multiple sources to gain insights into system behavior, identify trends, and detect anomalies.

Take action

- Use monitoring data to proactively address issues before they impact your system and take corrective action to remediate any problems that do arise.

<h3>What are the folden golden signals?</h3>

Health and performance of your AWS resources.

Latency

- Measures the time it takes for a system to respond to a requests. Real time or interactive applications.

Traffic

- Measures the volumes of requests being handled by a system. Usage and capacity.

Errors

- Measures the number of failed requests or other errors in a system. Identifies it's underlying infrastructure. 

Saturation 

- Measures the degree to which a system is operating at capacity. Potential bottlenecks or resource constraints that impacts performance.
